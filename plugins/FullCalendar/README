WHAT IS THE CAKEPHP FULL CALENDAR PLUGIN?
-----------------------------------------

The CakePHP Full Calendar Plugin allows you to easily integrate
the jQuery based Full Calendar application with your CakePHP 
application for a slick ajax event calendar.

The plugin brings the following MIT licensed software (see
LICENCE) together to create a simple and sleek experience:

-CakePHP (http://cakephp.org)
 Required by this plugin

-Full Calendar (http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar)
 The jQuery based Calendar

-jQuery (http://jquery.com)
 Required by Full Calendar

-jQuery UI (http://jqueryui.com)
 Required for draggable and resizable events

-qTip (http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip)
 A jQuery plugin for hover details

WHY?
----

While working on another project I needed a visual calendar for
event management for multiple users/accounts. From that project
I decided to simplify the calendar and turn it into a plugin
because there didn't appear to be a clean (easy to install and
use) CakePHP Calendar plugin out there.

In it's current form this plugin is for a single user though I
plan on creating a few associated plugins to allow for multiple
users, etc.

THE INSTALLATION PROCESS
------------------------

NOTE: These instructions assume you already have a working copy
of CakePHP with a database connection on your web server.

You can read up on CakePHP installation and DB config here:
http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/installation.html#installation AND
http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/orm/database-basics.html#database-configuration


INSTALLED IN 6 SIMPLE STEPS

1. download the full calendar zip https://github.com/curtisblack2004/CakePHP-Full-Calendar-Plugin/archive/3.x.zip

2. unzip contents to <your-cakephp3.x-app>/plugins/FullCalendar

3. use the sql file under plugins/FullCalendar/config to generate tables in your database

4. edit <your-cakephp3.x-app>/config/bootstrap.php and add:

	Plugin::load('FullCalendar', ['autoload' => true, 'bootstrap' => false, 'routes' => true]);

	to the end of the file.

5. You may need to alter the routes.php file in plugins/config/routes.php

6. You will also want to fix my code if you want to drag and drop the events and have the new time be saved correctly.

THAT'S IT!

You should now be able to access the Full Calendar Plugin at:
http://yoursite.com/full-calendar

You should add some Event Types first. Then you can start
scheduling some Events!
