I quit my job with no savings or safety net after purchasing some informational products on buying and selling real estate. I focused on buying and holding properties without using any of my own money or credit. My business took off after becoming skilled at negotiating short sales and generating over $30K average per deal.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EI have had the honor to experience quite a bit in the real estate world. I co-founded the Salt Lake Real Estate Investment Association in 2001, taught real estate seminars for over 3 years in Utah and Nevada, bought and sold raw land and commercial projects and even dabbled in note buying.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2007 and 2008, I bought a 58 lot subdivision, 2 tracts of land and over $5M worth of houses that I renovated. I violated all of my own rules and ended up losing everything during the real estate crash. After being out of the business for 3 years I dove back in a little over a year ago.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EI am very fortunate in that I have been exposed to the highs and lows of real estate. I consider myself lucky to have the opportunity to truly learn from my mistakes and have a second chance. Since getting back into real estate my business model has been to wholesale everything. I work in two markets (Utah and Idaho) and have wholesaled houses, multi-family properties and apartments. I am currently working on wholesaling two commercial projects. I create terms through lease options or owner financing and wholesale those properties as well. I use none of my own money (other than some earnest money), have no risk, and about a month ago made $53,600 on one wholesale deal!\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAs the market gets more saturated with investors, the competition continues to grow! It becomes harder and harder to find good deals. Let me show you how to find the deals, negotiate them, put them under contract, market them, get paid, and do it the right way so you can build your business. The last thing you want is the Division of Real Estate investigating you for selling real estate without a license. This will be a two part discussion ranging from beginner to advanced wholesaling.
